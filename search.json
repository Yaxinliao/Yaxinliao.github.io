It’s vitally important to secure the IIoT devices through analyzing the data generated by devices. IIoT uses IoT technologies that incorporate machine learning and big data techniques to allow one to gain insights from the data obtained from connected equipment. An effective anomaly analysis system is is highly desirable.</p>\n<p>The development of new intelligent systems in industrial manufacturing brings new challenges to analyzing data. In manufacturing, outliers may appear due to <strong>sensor noise</strong>, <strong>communication errors</strong>, <strong>process disturbances</strong>, <strong>instrument degradation</strong>, <strong>mechanical faults</strong>, <strong>human-related errors</strong>, and so on. In addition, <strong>data may becomethe target of external attackers; during the wireless transmission of data</strong>, an attacker could tamper with the data by <strong>launching aninjection attack</strong>, thus inducing the control systems to elicit incor-rect judgments, potentially disrupting the industrial operations,and inducing catastrophic failures. Therefore, outliers can be sensor noise, attacks, which often results from errors due to inaccurate data or can be items of interest such as significant anomalies caused by abnormal equipment conditions. In other words, an outlier may have two interpretations; it can be either noise or a significant anomaly. Traditional outlier detection algorithms are utilized to: 1) clean data, which considers both noise and significant anomalies as unclean data and filters the detected results to improve data quality and 2) detect unusual patterns, which is known as anomaly detection.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that finding anomalies for potential fault detection has become a broad research field. Most researchers in this area focus on anomaly detection, whilst only a few investigate the important issue of noise detection in data cleansing. It is difficult to effectively detect anomalies or other data-based analysis when the collected data are contaminated by noise.</p>\n<p>There are still multiple challenges in handling data within the IIoT—e.g., <strong>unreliable wireless transmission</strong>, <strong>a multiplicityof data sources</strong>, <strong>resource constraints</strong>, and <strong>low latency require-ments</strong>. Most of the existing research has investigated thesubjects of data preprocessing and intelligent controls indepen-dently. While this is theoretically possible with anend-to-enddeep learning approach, in practice, it is not feasible. In manyinstances, it is not practical to obtain massive labeled datasets.</p>\n<p>How to analyze voluminous data with noise and other influence (attack in wireless transmission) in IIoT applications is still a challenging and under-researched problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Solution\"><a href=\"#Solution\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Solution:\"></a>Solution:</h2><ol>\n<li>Denoting</li>\n<li>Robust anomaly detection</li>\n<li>Kind of like semantic communication</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Reference：\"><a href=\"#Reference：\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Reference：\"></a>Reference：</h2><p>[1] Y.
